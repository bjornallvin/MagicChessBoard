# Magic Chess Board
My attempt at creating a magic chess board with ai controlled self moving physical pieces. Which me luck!

## Features
 - Games modes:
   * Player vs Player  
   * Player vs Board 
   * Player vs Remote Web Player 
   * Player vs Remote Board player
 - When I lift a piece the board indicates with leds if that piece can be moved and possible locations to place it on.
 - I can get help on a good move from the AI
 - When it is the AIs turn, it will decide on a move and move the piece using a stepper engine controlled electromagnet under the table.

## Technology used
 - Wood working (box, adjusting pieces)
 - Mechanics (pulleys, ball bearings, timing belt)
 - Electronics (electro magnet, magnetic sensors, stepper engines, micro controllers, led strips)
 - 3D-printing (misc parts)
 - Programming (microcontrollers, chess server)

## Software used
